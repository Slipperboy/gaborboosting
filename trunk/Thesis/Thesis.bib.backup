  abstract = {Two-dimensional spatial linear filters are constrained by general
	uncertaintyrelations that limit their attainable information resolution
	for orientation,spatial frequency, and two-dimensional (2D) spatial
	position. The theoreticallower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty,
	of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose
	spatial weighting functionsare generated by exponentiated bivariate
	second-order polynomials withcomplex coefficients, the elliptic generalization
	of the one-dimensionalelementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous
	theory of communication[J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The
	set includes filters with variousorientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency
	bandwidths, and spatial dimensions,favoring the extraction of various
	kinds of information from an image.Each such filter occupies an irreducible
	quantal volume (correspondingto an independent datum) in a four-dimensional
	information hyperspace whoseaxes are interpretable as 2D visual space,
	orientation, and spatial frequency,and thus such a filter set could
	subserve an optimally efficient samplingof these variables. Evidence
	is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells
	in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal
	2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize
	the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectralinformation
	resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensionsand orientation
	and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlationsamong these,
	reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/lengthaspect
	ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of
	lab or in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace}

	attention of the system on a small image area. The second, a skin
	color method, is applied to the blobs to find skin regions (e.g.,
	faces, hands,etc.). The third, principal component analysis, is used
	to reduce the dimensionality of the data set and to detect face patterns.
	Finally, the obtained facelocations are fused to increase the detection
	reliability and to avoidfalse detections due to occlusions or unfavourable
	human poses. The proposedapproach is used by a video-based surveillance
	system for monitoring indoorscenes. }

	of a low-resolution whole face and individual face parts classifiers.
	Our approach is to use face parts information and change the identification
	strategy based on the results from individual face parts classifiers.
	These classifiers were implemented based on AdaBoost. Moreover, we
	propose a novel method based on a decision tree to improve performance
	of face detectors for occluded faces. The proposed decision tree
	method distinguishes partially occluded faces based on the results
	from the individual classifies. Preliminarily experiments on a test
	sample set containing non-occluded faces and occluded faces indicated
	that our method achieved better results than conventional methods.
	Actual experimental results containing general images also showed
	better results.}

	and facial features like eyes and nostrils and estimating basic mouth
	features such as degrees of openness and smile in real time. In developing
	this system, we have addressed the twin issues of image representation
	and algorithms for learning. We have used the invariance properties
	of image representations based on Haar wavelets to robustly capture
	various facial features. Similarly, unlike previous approaches this
	system is entirely trained using examples and does not rely on a
	priori (hand-crafted) models of facial features based on an optical
	flow or facial musculature. The system works in several stages that
	begin with face detection, followed by localization of facial features
	and estimation of mouth parameters. Each of these stages is formulated
	as a problem in supervised learning from examples. We apply the new
	and robust technique of support vector machines (SVM) for classification
	in the stage of skin segmentation, face detection and eye detection.
	Estimation of mouth parameters is modeled as a regression from a
	sparse subset of coefficients (basis functions) of an overcomplete
	dictionary of Haar wavelets}

  abstract = {We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in
	computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik
	and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method
	for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions
	classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly
	constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem
	is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and
	the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data
	points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global
	optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets.
	The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution
	of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which
	are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish
	the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental
	results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility
	of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data
	set of 50,000 data points}

	positive face examples for training. To collect negative examples,
	we use a bootstrap algorithm, which adds false detections into the
	training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult
	task of manually selecting nonface training examples, which must
	be chosen to span the entire space of nonface images. Simple heuristics,
	such as using the fact that faces rarely overlap in images, can further
	improve the accuracy. Comparisons with several other state-of-the-art
	face detection systems are presented, showing that our system has
	comparable performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates}

  abstract = {This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of
	processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection
	rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction
	of a new image representation called the ldquoIntegral Imagerdquo
	which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very
	quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is
	built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire,
	1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a
	very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a
	method for combining classifiers in a ldquocascaderdquo which allows
	background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending
	more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments
	in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face
	detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung
	and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000;
	Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection
	proceeds at 15 frames per second.}
